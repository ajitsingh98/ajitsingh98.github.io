excerpt: 'This Q&A covers fundamental concepts of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). It includes topics such as the maximal margin classifier, hyperplanes, margin optimization, support vectors, and kernel functions. Additionally, it explores the differences between SVM and SVR, including their applications, loss functions, hyperparameters, and how they handle non-linear boundaries and outliers.'
